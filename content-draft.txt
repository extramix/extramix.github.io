//ABOUT SECTION

Hello, my name is Sirapat Jariyanantakul. You can call me Mix. I'm 18 years old student
who are interested in technology and coding. I started coding when I was 17 years old with C# language with Unity game engine.
It was really difficult to digest new concepts into my head. But it turned to be fun after just 2 months of watching tutorials and started to build my own game.

after that game project was done, I looked into web development area and I find myself enjoy it. So, I started learning HTML,CSS and JavaScript then continued to JavaScript framework like Angular.
